# CardioCare AI - Flutter

A comprehensive heart disease detection mobile application built with Flutter and BLoC state management. This app provides AI-powered risk assessment, health tracking, and personalized recommendations for cardiovascular health.

## 🎯 Features

- **Heart Health Assessment**: Comprehensive health check questionnaire with medical parameters
- **AI-Powered Risk Analysis**: Calculate cardiovascular risk based on multiple factors
- **Risk Visualization**: Beautiful UI showing risk levels with color-coded indicators
- **Detailed Explanations**: AI-generated explanations of contributing risk factors
- **Assessment History**: Track your health assessments over time
- **User Profile**: Manage personal information and emergency contacts
- **Persistent Storage**: All data saved locally using SharedPreferences

## 🏗️ Architecture

This project follows Clean Architecture principles with BLoC (Business Logic Component) pattern for state management.

## 🏥 How It Works

### 1. Health Assessment Flow
1. User fills out comprehensive health questionnaire
2. Data includes: age, sex, chest pain type, blood pressure, cholesterol, etc.
3. Form validation ensures all required fields are completed

### 2. Risk Calculation
The app calculates cardiovascular risk based on:
- **Age**: Higher age increases risk
- **Chest Pain Type**: Typical angina is high risk
- **Blood Pressure**: Hypertension indicator
- **Cholesterol Levels**: High cholesterol increases risk
- **Exercise-Induced Angina**: Strong risk indicator
- **ST Depression**: Cardiac ischemia marker
- **Number of Vessels**: Blocked coronary arteries
- **Thalassemia**: Blood flow defects

### 3. Risk Levels
- **Low Risk (0-25%)**: Green indicators, maintenance recommendations
- **Medium Risk (25-70%)**: Yellow indicators, lifestyle modifications suggested
- **High Risk (70-95%)**: Red indicators, urgent medical consultation recommended

### 4. Persistent Data
- All assessments saved locally
- History tracking with timestamps
- User profile information stored securely
- No internet connection required

## 🎨 UI/UX Features

- **Modern Material Design**: Clean, intuitive interface
- **Smooth Animations**: Engaging user experience
- **Color-Coded Risk Levels**: Easy visual understanding
- **Responsive Layout**: Works on all screen sizes
- **Dark/Light Theme Support**: (Coming soon)
- **Accessibility**: Screen reader support, high contrast
